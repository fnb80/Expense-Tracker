# Project Title
 The Expense Tracker is an app that allows the user to manage and organize their financial spendings using lists, sorting functions, and calculators.

## Description
This is a user-friendly, operatable program that allows the user to create an expense tracker -- keep track of different finances such as transportation, food, and entertainment for organizing. It exists as not just a school project, but for a useful app as well.

**Contribution**    
Much of the code such as the *Add Expense, View Expense,* and *final checking* were developed by Eileen Wu, while *Delete Expense, Calculating Expenses* and *README* were written by Stephanie Cen.

**Challenges**    
The biggest challenge during this project was when the project was passed along to the other member, and they had to dissect each line to make sure theirs added up. For example, as the last two functions were being worked on, every variable had to be carefully checked to ensure no confusion or bugs. We understand this is a very common problem within collaborative coding, so with communication and careful reading, we were able to overcome this issue. Communication when there was a problem with phrases like "I'll work on fixing ..." and "Okay, I can do ..." aided in completing the project in a satisfactory timeframe.

## How to Run
To start, run the program and follow the input instructions. For example, the main program progressing buttons are **[1], [2], [3], [4],** and **[q]** on the keyboard 

## Features
**--Add an Expense**      
*This feature allows you to add an expense within a category such as food, transport, etc. Please ensure that you carefully type each input.*    
      
**--View Expenses**  
*This feature allows you to view every expense within each category.*    
    
**--Calculate Expenses**  
*This feature allows you to calculate either the total of one expense, or everything all together. Please ensure to carefully type each input.*     
    
**--Delete Expenses**   
*This feature allows you to remove expenses, which is useful if it no longer applies OR you have mispelled/mistyped anything. Please ensure to carefully remove the right expense!*       

## Technologies Used
In this program, we used Python as our language, along with external resources for bug fixing and research!

## Future Improvements
- Add a calender to create "due dates" for expenses
- Add a graph visual for easier viewing
- Add more user-friendly features to avoid bugs and misinputs
